# Data-Structures

A place to hold implementations of data structures for future reference.

* 4/5/2023 - Implemented Linked List
* 5/20/2023 - Finished implementing BST
* 5/26/2023 - Finished refactoring BST to include generics and functional interfaces.
* 6/2/2023 - A basic graph ADT is functional. Transferred LA Notes to this repository. The notes contain an intersection
of graph theory with linear algebra and algorithms broadly defined.
* 6/4/2023 - Sparse Graph class is finshed for now. Plan on looking at minimal spanning trees next.

Many of the vocab notes are from *Algorithms* Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein.
