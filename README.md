A place to hold implementations of data structures for future reference.

* 4/5/2023 - Implemented Linked List
* 5/20/2023 - Finished implementing BST
* 5/26/2023 - Finished refactoring BST to include generics and functional interfaces.
* 6/2/2023 - A basic graph ADT is functional. Transferred LA Notes to this repository. The notes contain an intersection
of graph theory with linear algebra and algorithms broadly defined.

Many of the vocab notes are from *Algorithms* Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein.
