## Properties of Trees:

**Theorem:** Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph. TFAE:

1. $G$ is a tree.
b. Any two vertices in $G$ are connected by a unique simple path.
c. $G$ is connected, but if any single edge is removed the resulting graph is disconnected.
d. $G$ is connected and #$E$ = #$V - 1$
e. $G$ is acyclic and #$E$ = #$V - 1$
f. $G$ is acyclic but if any edge is added the resulting graph contains a cycle.
